  abstract = {The estimation of the variance of the regression estimator for a twophase sample is considered. Given the covariance matrix of the first-phase control variables, a replication variance estimator that uses only the second-phase sample is developed. The procedure has computational advantages for surveys with secondphase samples that are small relative to the first-phase sample.}
