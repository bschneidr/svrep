  abstract = {The estimation of the variance of the regression estimator for a twophase sample is considered. Given the covariance matrix of the first-phase control variables, a replication variance estimator that uses only the second-phase sample is developed. The procedure has computational advantages for surveys with secondphase samples that are small relative to the first-phase sample.}

  abstract = {Labour force surveys are conducted to estimate quantities such as the unemployment rate and the number of people in work. Interest is typically both in estimates at a given time and in changes between two successive time points. Calibration of the sample to force agreement with known population margins results in random weights being assigned to each response, but the usual methods of variance estimation do not account for this. This paper describes how resampling methods-the jackknife, jackknife linearization, balanced repeated replication and the bootstrap-can be used to do so. We also discuss issues of implementation, and we compare the methods by simulation based on data from the UK Labour Force Survey. The broad conclusions are these: bootstrap and jackknife linearization are less computer intensive than the other resampling methods for such applications and give better standard errors; `standard' methods can be badly biased downwards; and it is essential to take variability of the weights into account.}

  abstract = {The bootstrap method is often used for variance estimation in sample surveys with a stratified multistage sampling design. It is typically implemented by producing a set of bootstrap weights that is made available to users and that accounts for the complexity of the sampling design. The Rao\textendash Wu\textendash Yue method is often used to produce the required bootstrap weights. It is valid under stratified with-replacement sampling at the first stage or fixed-size without-replacement sampling provided the first-stage sampling fractions are negligible. Some surveys use designs that do not satisfy these conditions. We propose a simple and unified bootstrap method that addresses this limitation of the Rao\textendash Wu\textendash Yue bootstrap weights. This method is applicable to any multistage sampling design as long as valid bootstrap weights can be produced for each distinct stage of sampling. Our method is also applicable to two-phase sampling designs provided that Poisson sampling is used at the second phase. We use this design to model survey nonresponse and derive bootstrap weights that account for nonresponse weighting. The properties of our bootstrap method are evaluated in three limited simulation studies.},

Sampling: Design and Analysis (SDA) will also benefit a non-statistics major with a desire to understand the concepts of sampling from a finite population. A student with patience to delve into the rigor of survey statistics will gain even more from the content that SDA offers. The updates to SDA have potential to enrich traditional survey sampling classes at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The new discussions of low response rates, non-probability surveys, and internet as a data collection mode hold particular value, as these statistical issues have become increasingly important in survey practice in recent years... I would eagerly adopt the new edition of SDA as the required textbook." (Emily Berg, Iowa State University) What is the unemployment rate? What is the total area of land planted with soybeans? How many persons have antibodies to the virus causing COVID-19? Sampling: Design and Analysis, Third Edition shows you how to design and analyze surveys to answer these and other questions. This authoritative text, used as a standard reference by numerous survey organizations, teaches the principles of sampling with examples from social sciences, public opinion research, public health, business, agriculture, and ecology. Readers should be familiar with concepts from an introductory statistics class including probability and linear regression; optional sections contain statistical theory for readers familiar with mathematical statistics. The third edition, thoroughly revised to incorporate recent research and applications, includes a new chapter on nonprobability samples-when to use them and how to evaluate their quality. More than 200 new examples and exercises have been added to the already extensive sets in the second edition. SDA's companion website contains data sets, computer code, and links to two free downloadable supplementary books (also available in paperback) that provide step-by-step guides-with code, annotated output, and helpful tips-for working through the SDA examples.
