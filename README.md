The goal of svrep is to implement methods for creating, updating, and
analyzing replicate weights for surveys. Functions from svrep can be
used to implement adjustments to replicate designs (e.g.Â nonresponse
weighting class adjustments) and analyze the effect of adjustments on
the replicate weights.
