#' @title Convert a survey design object to a bootstrap replicate design
#' @description Converts a survey design object to a replicate design object
#' with replicate weights formed using a bootstrap method. Supports stratified,
#' cluster samples with one or more stages of sampling. At each stage of sampling,
#' either simple random sampling (with or without replacement)
#' or unequal probability sampling (with or without replacement) may be used.
#' @param design A survey design object created using the 'survey' (or 'srvyr') package,
#' with class \code{'survey.design'} or \code{'svyimputationList'}.
#' @param type The type of bootstrap to use, which should be chosen based
#' on its applicability to the sampling method used for the survey.
#' The available types are the following: \cr
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{\strong{"Rao-Wu-Yue-Beaumont"} (the default): }{\cr
#'  The bootstrap method of Beaumont and Ã‰mond (2022), which is a generalization of the Rao-Wu-Yue bootstrap,
#'  and is applicable to a wide variety of designs, including single-stage and multistage stratified designs.
#'  The design may have different sampling methods used at different stages.
#'  Each stage of sampling may potentially be PPS (i.e., use unequal probabilities), with or without replacement,
#'  and may potentially use Poisson sampling. \cr \cr
#'  For a stratum with a fixed sample size of \eqn{n} sampling units, resampling in each replicate resamples \eqn{(n-1)} sampling units with replacement.}
#'  \item{\strong{"Rao-Wu"}: }{\cr
#'  The basic Rao-Wu \eqn{(n-1)} bootstrap method, which is only applicable to single-stage designs or
#'  multistage designs where the first-stage sampling fractions are small (and can thus be ignored).
#'  Accommodates stratified designs. All sampling within a stratum must be simple random sampling with or without replacement,
#'  although the first-stage sampling is effectively treated as sampling without replacement.}
#'  \item{\strong{"Preston"}: }{\cr
#'  Preston's multistage rescaled bootstrap, which is applicable to single-stage designs or multistage designs
#'  with arbitrary sampling fractions. Accommodates stratified designs. All sampling within a stratum must be
#'  simple random sampling with or without replacement.}
#'  \item{\strong{"Canty-Davison"}: }{\cr
#'  The Canty-Davison bootstrap, which is only applicable to single-stage designs, with arbitrary sampling fractions.
#'  Accommodates stratified designs. All sampling with a stratum must be simple random sampling with or without replacement.}
#' }
#' @param replicates Number of bootstrap replicates (should be as large as possible, given computer memory/storage limitations).
#' A commonly-recommended default is 500.
#' @param compress Use a compressed representation of the replicate weights matrix.
#' This reduces the computer memory required to represent the replicate weights and has no
#' impact on estimates.
#' @param mse If \code{TRUE}, compute variances from sums of squares around the point estimate from the full-sample weights,
#' If \code{FALSE}, compute variances from sums of squares around the mean estimate from the replicate weights.
#' @return
#' A replicate design object, with class \code{svyrep.design}, which can be used with the usual functions,
#' such as \code{svymean()} or \code{svyglm()}. \cr \cr
#' Use \code{weights(..., type = 'analysis')} to extract the matrix of replicate weights.
#' Use \code{as_data_frame_with_weights()} to convert the design object to a data frame with columns
#' for the full-sample and replicate weights.
#' @export
#' @seealso Use \code{\link[svrep]{estimate_boot_reps_for_target_cv}} to help choose the number of bootstrap replicates.
#'
#'          For some complex designs, one can use \code{\link[svrep]{make_rwyb_bootstrap_weights}} to create
#'          Rao-Wu-Yue-Beaumont bootstrap weights or adjustment factors given information for each stage of sampling
#'          (the type of sampling, strata IDs, cluster IDs, selection probabilities, etc.).
#'
#'          \cr \cr
#'
#'          For systematic samples, one-PSU-per-stratum designs, or other especially complex sample designs,
#'           one can use the generalized survey bootstrap method. See \code{\link[svrep]{make_gen_boot_factors}}.
