## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* As in previous accepted submissions, I see a note
about DOI links in the DESCRIPTION. The links are valid,
but it seems the URL checker isn't working correctly for
these DOI links.

## Downstream dependencies

* Check OK for downstream dependencies: 'nrba' (direct dependency) and 'idcnrba' (indirect dependency)
