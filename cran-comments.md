## R CMD check results

* As in previous accepted submissions, I see a note
about DOI links in the DESCRIPTION. The links are valid,
but it seems the URL checker isn't working correctly for
these DOI links.

* In yesterday's submission, I used the old-style `citEntry()` syntax in the `CITATION` file. Based on CRAN feedback, I've updated to use the new recommended `bibentry()` syntax.

## Downstream dependencies

* This package does not yet have any downstream dependencies.
