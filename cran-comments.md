* This update fixes the test errors on Windows from the current CRAN version's check results. The test errors were caused by an issue in the 'torch' package which affects Windows machines for 'svrep' and other packages. More details are available here: https://github.com/mlverse/torch/issues/1362.

## Downstream dependencies

* Check OK for downstream dependencies ('nrba', 'idcnrba', and 'sampcompR').
