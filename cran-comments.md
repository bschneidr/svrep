* As in previous accepted submissions, I see a note
about DOI links in the DESCRIPTION. The links are valid,
but it seems the URL checker isn't working correctly for
these DOI links.

* This is a patch release to fix a bug that would occur
frequently in practice. Apologies for submitting this
CRAN release soon after the last one.

## Downstream dependencies

* This package does not yet have any downstream dependencies.
