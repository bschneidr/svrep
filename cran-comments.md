0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This should fix the LaTeX error that strangely only appears on "r-oldrel-macos". I'm not sure why there was a LaTeX issue though for "r-oldrel-macos"; there wasn't any issue for the other flavors. Any guidance or suggestions would be appreciated.


## Downstream dependencies

* Check OK for downstream dependencies: 'nrba' (direct dependency) and 'idcnrba' (indirect dependency)
