Description: Provides tools for creating and working with survey replicate weights,
  extending functionality of the 'survey' package from Lumley (2004) <doi:10.18637/jss.v009.i08>.
  Implements bootstrap methods for complex surveys, including the generalized survey bootstrap
  as described by Beaumont and Patak (2012) <doi:10.1111/j.1751-5823.2011.00166.x>.
  Methods are provided for applying nonresponse adjustments to
  both full-sample and replicate weights as described by 
  Rust and Rao (1996) <doi:10.1177/096228029600500305>.
  Implements methods for sample-based calibration described by Opsomer and Erciulescu (2021) 
  <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/12-001-x/2021002/article/00006-eng.htm>.
  Diagnostic functions are included to compare weights and weighted estimates
  from different sets of replicate weights.
