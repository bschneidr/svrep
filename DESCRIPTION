Title: Tools for Creating, Updating, and Analyzing Survey Replicate Weights
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Author: Ben Schneider
Maintainer: Ben Schneider <benjamin.julius.schneider@gmail.com>
Description: Provides tools for creating and working with survey replicate weights,
  extending functionality of the 'survey' package from Lumley (2004) <doi:10.18637/jss.v009.i08>.
  Methods are provided for applying nonresponse adjustments to
  both full-sample and replicate weights as suggested by 
  Rust and Rao (1996) <doi:10.1177/096228029600500305> in order to account for
  the impact of these adjustments on sampling variances.
  Diagnostic functions are included to compare weights and weighted estimates
  from different sets of replicate weights.
