\title{Make a quadratic form matrix for the kernel-based variance estimator
of Breidt, Opsomer, and Sanchez-Borrego (2016)}
\usage{
make_kernel_var_matrix(x, kernel = "Epanechnikov", bandwidth = "auto")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector, giving the values
of an auxiliary variable.}

\item{kernel}{The name of a kernel function.
Currently only "Epanechnikov" is supported.}

\item{bandwidth}{The bandwidth to use for the kernel.
The default value is \code{"auto"}, which means that the bandwidth
will be chosen automatically to produce the smallest window size
while ensuring that every unit has a nonempty window,
as suggested by Breidt, Opsomer, and Sanchez-Borrego (2016).
Otherwise, the user can supply their own value, which can be a
single positive number.}
}
\value{
The quadratic form matrix for the variance estimator,
with dimension equal equal to the length of \code{x}. The resulting
object has an attribute \code{bandwidth} that can be retrieved
using \code{attr(Q, 'bandwidth')}
}
\description{
Constructs the quadratic form matrix
for the kernel-based variance estimator of Breidt, Opsomer, and Sanchez-Borrego (2016).
The bandwidth is automatically chosen to result
in the smallest possible nonempty kernel window.

\details{
Suppose there are \eqn{H} strata, and
for each stratum \eqn{i} there is a numeric population characteristic \eqn{x_i}
and there is a weighted total \eqn{\hat{Y}_i}, where
\eqn{\hat{Y}_i} is only observed in the selected sample but \eqn{x_i}
is known prior to sampling. We assume that only one sampling unit
is sampled from each stratum (systematic sampling is a special case).

The variance estimator has the following form:

\deqn{
  \hat{V}_{ker}=\frac{1}{C_d} \sum_{i=1}^H (\hat{Y}_i-\sum_{j=1}^H d_j(i) \hat{Y}_j)^2
}

The terms \eqn{d_j(i)} are kernel weights given by

\deqn{
  d_j(i)=\frac{K(\frac{x_i-x_j}{h})}{\sum_{j=1}^H K(\frac{x_i-x_j}{h})}
}

where \eqn{K(\cdot)} is a symmetric, bounded kernel function
and \eqn{h} is a bandwidth parameter. The normalizing constant \eqn{C_d}
is computed as:

\deqn{
  C_d=\frac{1}{H} \sum_{i=1}^H(1-2 d_i(i)+\sum_{j=1}^H d_j^2(i))
}
}
\examples{
# The auxiliary variable has the same value for all units
make_kernel_var_matrix(c(1, 1, 1))

# The auxiliary variable differs across units
make_kernel_var_matrix(c(1, 2, 3))

# View the bandwidth that was automatically selected
Q <- make_kernel_var_matrix(c(1, 2, 4))
attr(Q, 'bandwidth')
